# es6-functional-programming
Repository to test some basic concepts of functional programming using es6 high order functions.

## How to start
Open `/test/exercisesTest.js` file and start solving all the tests in that file.

## Rules
Make sure not to change any assertion (expect clause), just implement the function marked with `/*TODO*/` comment.

Some exercises needs to be solved using a specific function (i.e compose), and all of them must be coded using a functional approach (don't use for/forEach statemenents).

If you want to view one way of solving this exercise, just take a look at `solved` branch.

Good luck!
